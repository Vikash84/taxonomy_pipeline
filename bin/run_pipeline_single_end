# This is the master script for running a pipeline, the main goal of which is 
# taxonomically assign the reads in a sequencing dataset that remain after filtering 
# of host sequences. 
#
# The main steaps in the pipeline are:
#
#  (*) quality assessment w/ FastQC
#
#  (*) trimming or removal of low quality sequences and collapse of non-unique reads [run_preprocessing_pipeline]
#
#  (*) quality assessment w/ FastQC
#
#  (*) filtering of host sequences [via the script specified by host_filtering_script]
#
#  (*) de novo assembly of remaining reads and taxonomic assement of contigs, first by nt to nt alignments (blastn) and then by 
#      translated-nt to protein alignments (diamond)  [contig_based_taxonomic_assessment]
#
#  (*) taxonomic assement of non contig-mapping reads, first by nt to nt alignments (blastn) and then by translated-nt to protein 
#      alignments (diamond)  [contig_based_taxonomic_assessment]
#
# 
# The major modifiable step is to specify the host_filtering_script parameter, which
# should refer to a script that will remove host reads (see below)
#
#

# this is the sample ID and the base name of the file.  This script expects a single read file to exist in the same
# directory as this script is located of the form ${id}_R1.fastq 
id=$1

# pre-filtering FastQC 
fastqc ${id}_R1.fastq 

# run quality trimming, adapter trimming, unique collapsing script for this sample -> output ${id}_R[12]_fu.fastq
./run_preprocessing_pipeline_single_end $id

# post-filtering FastQC 
fastqc ${id}_R1_fu.fastq 

#
# Specify a host filtering script.  This script can be whatever you want, but should create
# a host sequence-filtered fastq files of the form ${id}_R1_fuh.fastq 
#
# One way to handle multiple different host filtering scripts is to create a file that
# maps id -> host filtering script.  For instance, a 2 column file with id in the first column
# and the name of the host mapping script in the 2nd column.  Then you could run this command
# to get the name of the script for each particular ID
#
#       host_filtering_script=`grep $id host_filtering.txt | cut -f 2`
# 
# Or, simply state name of the script.  The script should be in this directory and have executable permissions:
# 
# for example:
#
# host_filtering_script=filter_cow_reads
#
# or:
# 
host_filtering_script=filter_fly_reads_single_end

# run whatever host filtering script for this sample -> output ${id}_R[12]_fuh.fastq
./$host_filtering_script $id

# make contigs and taxonomically assess those
./contig_based_taxonomic_assessment_single_end $id

# taxonomically assess singletons (reads that don't map to contigs)
# ./read_based_taxonomic_assessment_single_end $id
